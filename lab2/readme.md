## Dataset Selection

For this project, an open-source tabular dataset was selected from Kaggle. The dataset used is the **House Prices Dataset**, which is provided in CSV format and contains information about residential properties along with their sale prices.

This dataset is suitable for a machine learning task because it consists of structured numerical and categorical features that can be used for prediction. It does not contain image, audio, or text-heavy data, which aligns with the lab requirements.
